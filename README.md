# Python Synchronization Server

Quick python multithreaded socket server implementation for use in my other projects. Feel free to use as well.

## TODO

- Improve the client side process, so that it is more clear to readers
- Add the handling case when the client turned itself off, the server should reflect that as well
- Make the interface layer for the program (Command line arguments)
