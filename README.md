# Python Synchronization Server

Quick python multithreaded socket server implementation to demonstrate my understanding of some operating sytem concepts.

## Usage

To run the synchronization socket server, follow these steps.

1. Run the following command: `python3 socket_server_main.py`

## TODO

- Improve the client side process, so that it is more clear to readers
- Add the handling case when the client turned itself off, the server should reflect that as well
- Make the interface layer for the program (Command line arguments)
